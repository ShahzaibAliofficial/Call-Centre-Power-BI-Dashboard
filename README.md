### Project Title: Call Center Performance Dashboard

#### Project Overview:
This project features a **Call Center Performance Dashboard** built to visualize and analyze key metrics related to call center operations. The dashboard helps track important KPIs such as the total number of calls, average response times, and overall agent performance. It is designed to aid in performance monitoring, enhancing the efficiency of call center management.

#### Key Features:
- **Total Calls Overview**: Displays the total number of calls handled by the center.
- **Average Answered Time**: Highlights the average time it takes for a call to be answered by agents.
- **Average Talk Duration**: Shows the average duration of conversations handled by agents.
- **Answered and Resolved Calls**: Tracks the total number of calls answered and resolved, providing insight into overall call efficiency.

#### Agent-Specific Metrics:
- A breakdown of key performance indicators (KPIs) for individual agents, such as:
  - **Total Calls** handled per agent.
  - **Answered Calls** and **Average Talk Duration**.
  - **Answer Rate** (percentage of calls answered within an optimal time frame).
  - **Average Rating** based on customer feedback.

#### Data Visualizations:
- **Call Trends Per Day**: A dynamic bar chart representing daily call trends, helping to identify busy periods and optimize staffing.
- **Calls Per Rating**: A bar chart showing customer feedback based on call ratings, allowing for the evaluation of customer satisfaction.
- **Calls by Topic**: A pie chart breaking down calls by topics or reasons for contact, which helps in understanding the main focus areas of customer queries.

#### Date Range Filter:
The dashboard includes an interactive **Date Filter** that allows users to view data for specific periods, making it easier to analyze trends over time.

#### Technologies Used:
- **Power BI**: The dashboard is built using Power BI, showcasing advanced features like dynamic filtering, calculated columns, and custom visualizations to display real-time data effectively.

#### Use Cases:
- Call center management can use this dashboard to:
  - Monitor agent performance and identify areas for improvement.
  - Analyze daily and long-term call trends.
  - Track and enhance customer satisfaction.
  - Optimize operational efficiency based on insights from the data.

#### How to Use:
1. Download the Power BI report file.
2. Load your own data or explore the embedded dataset.
3. Interact with the visualizations to explore various call center metrics.
4. Use filters to analyze data for specific agents, time periods, or topics.

#### Future Enhancements:
- Integration with live data sources to provide real-time tracking.
- Addition of predictive analytics to forecast future call volumes and agent performance.
